## The History of Battleships

  Origionating from the early 1900s Battleships began as a game played with pen and paper. The first Published version of Battleships was in 1931 under the name "Salvo" by Starex Novelty co., still played with paper and pen but now with specifically printed pads to play on. Unlike today each player had as many shots as they did ships with some variations giving specific ships two shots. Once a player has anounced all shots the other would respond by saying how many shots hit and what was hit, without revealing which shot did which. Later in the 30s and 40s it was published again under other names such as Combat: The Battleship Game and Broadside: A Game of Naval Strategy. In 1967 Battleship was released by Milton Bradly and looked very similar to how it does today, now made of plastic containing small peices to signify ships, hits, misses aswell as the boards one horizontal to house your ships and another for your guesses. In the 80s and 90s new versions of the game and spin-offs were released and it was adapted into video games.In 2012 it was even made into a feature film.
